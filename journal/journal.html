    <h1>Journal 1: What makes a good form?</h1>

<article>

    <p>To sum up the article that was provided for us to read <br>
        some of the practices that one must implement when creating <br>
        a good form include; Clarity and Simplicity, Logical Flow, Consistent Design, <br>
        User-Friendly Input Fields, Good Error Handling, Accessibility, Mobile Responsiveness,<br>
        Progress Indicators, Consent and Privacy as well as Testing and Iteration.</p>

     <p>A website that I found to have good form design was the Spotify Pets website as it <br>
         has good responsiveness when it comes to moving on to the next section and selecting<br>
         what you have already picked.</p>
