    <h1>Game Design Research</h1>

    <p>The article basically summarised on how to make games a better user experience for the player.</p><br>
    <p>The article started off with an introduction about game design and how it relates to UX before diving deeper into understanding player motivation.<br>Player motivation is inherently what the UX needs to be based upon so that people would want to play your game.<br>It then talks about how important user research is to integrate successful UX and UI.</p>
    <p>Then the bulk of the article is spent talking about accessibility as well as the different steps in making a game such as onboarding and tutorials all the way to the navigation and UI design.</p>
    <p>As far as a successful game goes, it must provide good feedback and progression systems to keep the user inticed and give him something to work towards. </p>
    <p>THe last but unfortunately arguably most important thing that the article mentions is Monetization and in Game Purchases as a game cannot survive if it is not profiting.</p>
